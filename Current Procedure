(For now)
1. Select 3-4 fields(minimum missing) containing discrete data from the properties_2016.csv
2. Reduce number of rows to 5k or so
3. Check their correlation via pearson correlation test(to drop redundant data)
4. Implement classification algorithms on the reduced fields
5. Add a continuous field and Devise a way to predict using both types(dont worry about consistency/validity of the hypothesis for now)
